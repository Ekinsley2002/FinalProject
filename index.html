  Creating the lights out game was moderately challenging, I had to first think how I would start this project. Looking into the instructions it says to start with just making one tile that changes color when you click on it. After this I had to handle the events of the other tiles touching that one. I hit a few road bumps in the process and had to debug using the terminal on the website. Once I got the game to work I tested whether the output of winning would work so I had to beat it. This also took a little effort, but once I was sure that the game worked, I centered it on the middle of the screen and created the title. Lastly, I had to make the addendum, doing this wasn't hard, but lining it up under the gameboard took a little longer than expected. After logging my challenges in this addendum I completed the assignment!
